## Port GregTech: Refreshed to Modern Industrialization
Made this for the lack of GTM in ATM10  
(GregTech: Refreshed is the default texture for GTM)  
Requires [**Athena**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/athena) mod to work

## Progress
Blocks & Machines : 70%  
Items : 0%

## Issues
Some blocks in MI don't exist in GTM  
I'll re-color some already existing textures in GTM to fix that

The ctm textures of machine controllers and hatches don't work in ATM10
(Works fine in my testing instance with fresh MI and athena installed, i don't know what's going on)

I don't know how to get emissive textures to work
