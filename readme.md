## Port GregTech: Refreshed to Modern Industrialization
Made this for the lack of GTM in ATM10  
(GregTech: Refreshed is the default texture for GTM)  
Requires [**Athena**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/athena) mod to work

## Progress
Blocks & Machines : 70%  
Items : 0%

## Issues
Some blocks in MI don't exist in GTM  
I'll re-color some already existing textures in GTM to fix that

I don't know how to get emissive textures to work
