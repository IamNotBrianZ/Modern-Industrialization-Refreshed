## Port GregTech: Refreshed to Modern Industrialization

Made this for the lack of GTM in ATM10  
(GregTech: Refreshed is the default texture for GTM)  
Requires **Athena** mod to work

## Issues

Some blocks in MI don't exist in GTM  
I'll re-color some already existing in GTM to fix that

I don't know how to get emissive textures to work
